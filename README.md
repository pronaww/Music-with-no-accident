# Music-with-no-accident

As there are many accidents happening due to people listening to music. We came up with this idea of listening to music with caution. The main reason for these accidents were that the people were not aware of their surrounding. They are so much induldge in their music. They they stop caring about their environment. Their ears become sort of deaf to other noises happening around.

What we want to propose is that, we want to build a background service which can run in every device and starts whenever a music player starts playing songs with the device having headphone, earphone or any audio device connected such car audio system. So, whenever the person is driving car, motorbike or walking on the footpath and listening to music and a car blows horn. The background service will come into play and will sense the noise of horn and will automatically reduce the volume of the sound and will give a feedback in terms of sound and vibration(in case of mobile phone) and this will let the person to get aware of their surrounding so that he/she can make the correct actions to prevent the accident that could happen. In case of car, what the service will do is that it , when connected to the audio system of the car, will do the same thing and alert the car driver about the surrounding so that he/she can save him from accident.

One peculiar problem, that this project will face is that it will not be useful when someone is again and again blowing horn nearby. This is the case also when the person is in stucked in heavy traffic. This can be solved by alerting the user once and then machine learning will come into play. We can train the model to detect various noises and try to figure out more about the surrounding by detecting the distance from where horn is blown by detecting its intensity. The user will also have the option to tell the service that he/she have acknowledged and is now aware of surrounding. This will solve both the problem of stuck in traffic and when someone is trying to break the service. 

In phones, since all audio devices have mic in-built in it, the service will use this mic to get the audio input for pedestrians and for car users, an external mic have to be installed in outside part of car to detect the sounds around. 

### Future goals:
This project will later use the dopler effect to detect the incoming traffic, its direction and speed. This will greatly enhance the accuracy of the project. The sensor have to be additionaly installed on the car and in the phone, it can be fitted in the back cover case of the phones.

Thus, million of lives can be saved with this service.
